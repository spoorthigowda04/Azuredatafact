# Azure Data Factory End-to-End Data Pipeline (Bronze–Silver–Gold Architecture)
This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Azure Data Factory to process raw data into analytics-ready datasets following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).
The pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, and data curation to enable structured and reliable reporting and analytics

## Architecture
Raw Data → Bronze Layer → Silver Layer → Gold Layer
Bronze Layer: Stores raw ingested data without modification.
Silver Layer:Applies data cleaning and transformations.
Gold Layer:Provides refined datasets ready for analytics and reporting.

 ## Tech Stack
